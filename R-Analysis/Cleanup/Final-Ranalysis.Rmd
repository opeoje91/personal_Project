This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
month_summary<- subset(official_table) %>% group_by(Month) %>% summarize(Mean_volume=mean(Volume), .groups = 'keep') #create summary table for months by volume 

month_plt <- ggplot(month_summary,aes(x=Month,y=Mean_volume)) #import dataset into ggplot2

month_plt + geom_line()


```
```{r}
official_table <- read.csv(file='AAPL_Pre_Official_DB_7_31.csv',check.names=F,stringsAsFactors = F)#Reading the official file
year_summary_season <- subset(official_table) %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarize(Mean_volume=mean(Volume), .groups = 'keep') #create summary table
plt_year_summary_season <- ggplot(year_summary_season,aes(x=Year,y=Mean_volume)) #import dataset into ggplot2

plt_year_summary_season + geom_point() + xlab("Year") + ylab("Mean_volume") #add scatter plot with labels
plt_year_summary_season + geom_point() + labs(x="Year", y="Mean_volume", size=15)#add scatter plot with labels
+ geom_point(aes(shape=Months)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
